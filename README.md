# Configuration Files
My dotfile configuration setup. This is a major work in progress and requires a number of preinstalled applications, such as the xonsh shell and the awscli. Use these at your own risk

This repository now uses stow to symlink in all dotfiles due to difficulty in cloning down.

A pure `stow.sh` is provided to just stow the individual items, a `clean.sh` is used to clean out the old files, and a `setup.sh` is provided to tie them together.
